# Agent-Based Market Coupled Supply Chain Optimization

“An Agent-Based Simulation and Optimization Framework for Resource Allocation Decisions in a Bio-Based Isopropanol Supply Chain”

This repository contains the implementation of a simulation-optimization framework that couples:

supply chain process optimization

agent-based market simulation (Q-learning bidding)

metaheuristic policy search (Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO)

The framework studies decision-dependent market environments where allocation policies affect price formation and market behavior.
